# Stock Analytics Dashboard

## What I Learned from This Project
This project was my first time working with a few technologies, such as Chart.js, PostgreSQL, and Supabase. I struggled a bit with their integration, especially with Chart.js, but overall, it was a fun and rewarding experience. Additionally, I learned about separate hosting for different parts of the project. For this project, I've used:
- **Vercel** for the frontend,
- **Render Web Services** for the Python backend, and
- **Render PostgreSQL Services** for the database.

## Challenges I Faced
1. **Chart.js Integration Issues** – I faced a lot of challenges with Chart.js, particularly with typecasting of different options. Ultimately, I had to write two separate versions for the two types of charts, but it was a great learning experience.
2. **Database Transition** – Initially, I used Supabase as I had been wanting to learn it for some time. However, after completing the implementation, I realized that my marks would be lowered if I didn't use a Python backend. This led me to switch to PostgreSQL, causing some delays but giving me experience with both.
3. **Typescript Errors** – Since I used TypeScript, I encountered several type errors along the way. Fortunately, I was able to resolve them by thoroughly reading documentation and debugging.

- **Backend:** [Stock Analytics Dashboard API](https://stock-analytics-dashboard-1.onrender.com/)

> **Note:** As I'm using the free tier of Render.com, the backend goes to sleep whenever there is no traffic. As a result, it might take around a minute for the website to wake up again.
